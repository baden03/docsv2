When building a website, there may be sections on the website such as events and projects where the content and appearance are very different from posts and pages. That's when you need custom post types.

## What are custom post types?

Custom post types are different types of content in WordPress. You should consider creating a custom post type for a particular content type if:

- It needs to be displayed differently from posts and pages, or
- It doesn't look and feel like a post or a page, or
- It needs some additional fields and characteristics

## How to create a custom post type?

Creating custom post types is done easily with the **MB Custom Post Types & Custom Taxonomies** extension. This extension is already bundled in Meta Box AIO, MB Core, or you can install it for free from [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mb-custom-post-type/).

To create a new custom post type, go to **Meta Box Â» Post Types** and click **New Post Type**:

And you'll see a screen to configure the post type:

In most cases, you only need to enter the plural name, singular name, and slug in the **General** tab and click the **Publish** button to register the post type.

:::caution Don't use WordPress reserved terms

There is a complete set of [WordPress reserved terms](https://codex.wordpress.org/Reserved_Terms) that should **not** be used for the post type slug as they may conflict with WordPress core functionality.

### Post type settings

If you want to customize the post type such as changing the menu icon or disabling the block editor (Gutenberg) for it, please see the settings below.

From our experience, the most important settings are in the **Advanced** tab.

### Generate PHP code

If you're familiar with PHP, you might want to get the PHP code to register the post type. To do that, click the **Get PHP Code** button and copy the generated code. Then can insert it into your theme's `functions.php` file (or your plugin's file). After inserting, you can deactivate the extension to make your site a little bit faster.

## FAQ

<FAQ question="Why do I see 404 errors (not found) for my custom post type?">

The problem is that WordPress hasn't refreshed the rewrite rules for the custom post type. Please go to **Settings Â» Permalink** and re-save the settings.

</FAQ>

<FAQ question="How do I customize the permalink for custom post types?">

Meta Box only supports changing the rewrite slug for custom post types. If you want more customization for the permalink, you'll need a plugin like [Custom Post Type Permalinks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-post-type-permalinks/) or if you're a developer, you can follow [this guide](https://www.shibashake.com/wp/custom-post-type-permalinks-part-2).

</FAQ>

<FAQ question="How do I change a post type slug without losing posts?">

After changing your post type slug, you can use the plugin [Post Type Switcher](https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-type-switcher/) to switch the posts from the old post type to the new one.

</FAQ>

<FAQ question="Will my posts be deleted if I remove a post type?">

No, they're still in the database, but not visible. To show them again, simply create a post type with the old slug.

</FAQ>

## Next steps

After creating a custom post type, you might want to add some custom taxonomies to categorize them or add custom fields to enter more details for each post of that post type. Let's continue with [custom taxonomies](/creating-taxonomies/).
