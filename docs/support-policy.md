## Support channels

The official support channel is the [support forum](https://support.metabox.io), which is public. Only premium users can open a new topic. For free plugins, we also support via [WordPress.org support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/meta-box/).

Besides, there is a [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/metaboxusers), which is for community discussion, not for support.

We rarely support via email. Email is mostly used for sending private info. Please use the support forum first before sending us emails.

## Scope of support

We only support our plugins, not general WordPress issues (like custom post types, custom taxonomies, etc.). Our support includes plugin installation, configuration, update and use.

We do **not** support:

- Bugs that come from other plugins.
- Compatibility with other plugins, unless we have an extension for them.
- For plugins that officially support Meta Box, like Oxygen Builder, SearchWP, Admin Columns, ... please reach out to them if you have any issue with installation, configuration, compatibility, or usage.
- For other plugins that don't have support for Meta Box, contact them to ask for Meta Box integration, or [let us know](https://metabox.io/contact/) so we can put it in our roadmap. Anyway, we can't promise or guarantee future integration.
- Customization for your specific needs.
- Custom development. We do custom development **as an outsourcing service** and are [available for hire](https://metabox.io/contact/).


## Support time

All questions will be answered within 24 hours.

We support during the working time from 8 AM to 5 PM in the ICT timezone (GMT+7), from Monday to Friday. For questions asked on the weekends or holidays, they'll be answered in the next working day.
