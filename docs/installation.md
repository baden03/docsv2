## Requirements

To run Meta Box, we recommend:
- PHP 7.4 or greater
- Latest version of WordPress

While Meta Box also works with PHP 5.6 and older versions of WordPress, these versions have reached the official End Of Life and as such may expose your site to security vulnerabilities.

## Installing Meta Box

The Meta Box plugin is [available on wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/meta-box/). To install it, go to **Plugins &rarr; Add New** and search for **Meta Box**.

Then click the button **Install** to install it. After that, click the button **Activate** to activate the plugin.

## Installing extensions

Before installing extensions, make sure you installed and activated the Meta Box plugin, even if you use Meta Box AIO, MB Core, or solutions.

Meta Box extensions are normal WordPress plugins, follow these steps to install them:

- Go to [My Account](https://metabox.io/my-account/) and download the extensions you want to use.
- Go to **Plugins**, click **Add new**, then click **Upload plugin**.
- Choose the `.zip` file you downloaded and click **Install now**
- After finishing the upload, click **Activate** to finish.

## Next steps

Now you have everything ready, you may be wondering what to learn next. We strongly recommend following step-by-step guides in the "Getting started" category.

When you're familiar with Meta Box, you might want to go to the [Advanced](/category/advanced/) category. And if you need to know how a field or an extension work, please go to their docs under [Field types](/category/fields/) or [Extensions](/category/extensions/) categories. You can also search for the things you need, sometimes it helps you find the exact docs faster.

For now, as most WordPress websites require custom post types, let's [learn how to create them](/creating-post-types/).
