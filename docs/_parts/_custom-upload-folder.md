To upload files to a custom folder, set "Custom upload folder" to your folder full path.

If you're using code to create this field, you can use WordPress constants to specify the path easier, such as:

```php
'upload_dir' => ABSPATH . '/invoices/',

// or

'upload_dir' => WP_CONTENT_DIR . '/invoices/',
'unique_filename_callback' => 'my_function',
```

The custom folder should be inside your WordPress website's root folder. So you can store it in `/uploads/`, `/downloads/` folders if you want. The configuration is *per* field, so you can have one field storing files in `/downloads/` and another field in `/invoices/`.

The uploaded file name is normally the original file name and maybe with the suffix "-1", "-2" to prevent duplicated names. In case you want to set custom names for files, pass your custom callback to the setting `unique_filename_callback`.

Unlike the normal case, where files are added to the WordPress Media Library, files uploaded to custom folders are **not available in the Media Library**. Thus, the data saved in the custom fields is **file URL**, not attachment ID.

To get the field data, you can use `get_post_meta()` to get file URL, or use `rwmb_meta()` to get an array of file details which includes: `path`, `url` and `name`.
