title: Export/Import custom fields with Meta Box Builder
---

Instead of <a href="https://metabox.io/copy-custom-fields-with-meta-box-builder/">using code to embed custom fields from one site to others</a>, we could use another method supported by <a href="https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-builder/">Meta Box Builder</a>. This extension allows you to export/import custom fields fast and easily.

## Step 1: Install and activate Meta Box Builder

Before getting started, we need to have the <a href="https://metabox.io/">Meta Box plugin</a> and <a href="https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-builder/">Meta Box Builder</a> on 2 websites.

You can freely download and activate the <a href="https://metabox.io/">Meta Box plugin</a> on <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/meta-box/">wordpress.org</a> to have a framework to create custom fields.

Then, go to **My Account** or use **Meta Box AIO**to install and activate the <a href="https://metabox.io/plugins/meta-box-builder/">Meta Box Builder</a> to have an intuitive UI to create custom fields in the WordPress page admin.

After that, you’ll see a new **Meta Box** menu as below:

## Step 2: Create custom fields

To export/import custom fields, first, we need to create field groups that contain custom fields.

We have a tutorial for creating custom fields with Meta Box Builder, please take a look for more detail <a href="https://metabox.io/add-configure-custom-fields-meta-box-builder/">here</a>.

Here we’ll create a field group named **Author** and export/import its settings to other sites.

## **Step 3: Export/Import custom fields with Meta Box Builder**

### Export Field Groups and Custom Fields

To export the custom fields, go to **Meta Box** &gt; **Custom Fields**.

Then a list of field groups will appear. Choose the ones you want to export by ticking the checkbox.

Next, there are two ways to export the field groups.

If you choose one field group, simply click on its **Export** option like this:

In case you export several field groups, press the **Bulk actions** dropdown, then select the **Export** option and **Apply**.

After that, the file that contains the data of the selected field groups will be downloaded automatically.

### Import field groups and custom fields to another website

In the dashboard of another website you want to import the field group, go to **Meta Box** &gt; **Custom Fields** &gt; **Import**.

Then click on **Choose File** and select the downloaded file to import the field group. Here I will choose the **Author** field group that I’ve already created and exported in the previous step.

Then go back to the field groups list, and you can see the imported field group is displayed as follows:

To check whether the field group works well, you might create/edit a page or post, its data will display similar to the original website.
